# WELCOME TO CLIMATEDATA.CA's INTERACTIVE AGRICULTURE SECTOR CLIMATE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL

## This interactive tool is designed for farmers, crop advisors, agrologists or others involved in the agriculture sector.  The tool has two main goals:

- **GOAL 1** - Gain a better sense of how to select useful climate change information for agriculture-specific climate change considerations, including risk assessments and long term planning.

- **GOAL 2** - Help find some useful climate change information for your farm.

## You will be guided through the following 5 steps:

- **STEP 1** - Provide basic information about your farm
- **STEP 2** - Develop an inventory of revelant considerations (e.g., crop systems, buildings, fuel storages)
- **STEP 3** - Identify the local weather and climate hazards that may matter for your farm
- **STEP 4** - Explore the impacts of weather and climate hazards on agricultural buildings, livestock, crops, and/or other components
- **STEP 5** - Summary report and next steps

## This process should take around 20 minutes to complete!  Have fun!
