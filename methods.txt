Climate information, specifically of future climate projections, is a crucial input to climate change risk assessments and subsequent adaptation planning.  However, decision makers often lack understanding of the decision framework underpins climate information data and use for practical use, and furthermore may not be capable of confidently identifying 'best in class' information and data sources.

The tool encapsulated in this Jupyter Notebook is meant to aid users in 1) deciding which climate information would be useful for their climate change risk/adaptation work, and 2) providing access to user-specific well-vetted information and data.  In helping users in their initial climate information decision process, this tool implicitly guides users through the first key steps of a climate change risk/adaptation workflow, and furthermore provides them with useful links to real, user-relevant, decision-guided climate data and information.

## Decision Support Tool Design

### Conceptual Design

#### Climate Change Impact, Risk, and Vulnerability Assessment Methods

Climate change information is most often used for impact, vulnerability and risk analyses in support of climate adaptation planning.  For this reason, the decision rules encapsulated in this decision support tool reflect fundamental elements of general vulnerability and risk assessment.  In particular, the first steps of general vulnerability and risk assessment (e.g. [ISO 31000:2018](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:31000:en)) are used to develop an understanding of the major components of a system in question, and the major impacts that may present risk to these components.  These principles form much of the basis of key climate change risk assessment frameworks in use today in Canada across multiple sectors, including engineering ([PIEVC](https://pievc.ca/)), community planning ([ICLEI BARC](https://icleicanada.org/barc-program/)), and this vulnerability and risk-relevant information and data sources is a second key outcome.

#### Decision Support System Methods

The decision rules and general design of this tool also adhers to [general principles of decision support systems](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.476.4750&rep=rep1&type=pdf) which generally target unstructured, poorly specified problems, combine user interaction and guidance with data access and retrieval functions, are easy and intuitive to use interactive; and are adaptable to changes in specific applications and decision making approaches.  Such tools help decision makers utilize data to solve unstructured problems - in this case, to perform climate impact, vulnerability and risk assessments.
